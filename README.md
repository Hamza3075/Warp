# Warp
A comprehensive implementation of a production-ready NLP system leveraging deep learning and transformer architecture. This system includes everything needed to train, evaluate, and deploy NLP models for various tasks such as text classification and sequence generation.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of model, data, training, inference, and API components
- **Transformer-based Model**: Custom implementation with configurable layers, heads, and dimensions
- **Efficient Training Pipeline**: With checkpointing, resumability, and evaluation metrics
- **Inference Engine**: Includes caching and batching for optimized performance
- **FastAPI Server**: API interface for model inference with input validation
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for easy deployment
- **Monitoring Integration**: Optional Prometheus and Grafana setup for observability
- **Extensible Design**: Support for various NLP tasks like classification and text generation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-system.git
   cd nlp-system
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through the `config.json` file. Key configuration sections include:

- **model**: Model architecture parameters such as layers, dimensions, etc.
- **training**: Training hyperparameters, data paths, and checkpoint settings
- **inference**: Model serving configuration
- **api**: API server settings
- **logging**: Logging configuration
- **feedback_loop**: Settings for continual learning

## Usage

### Training

To train a model:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config config.json
```

Optional arguments:
- `--train-file PATH`: Path to training data
- `--eval-file PATH`: Path to evaluation data
- `--checkpoint-dir PATH`: Directory to save checkpoints
- `--batch-size N`: Batch size
- `--learning-rate LR`: Learning rate
- `--epochs N`: Number of training epochs
- `--use-wandb`: Enable Weights & Biases tracking
- `--task TYPE`: Task type (classification or generation)
- `--resume PATH`: Path to checkpoint to resume training from

### Deployment

To deploy the trained model as an API:

```bash
python scripts/deploy.py --config config.json
```

Optional arguments:
- `--model-path PATH`: Path to trained model
